Version 0.8.3 (Sep 30, 2010)
----------------------------

  * Oops, typo in settings.py - Toby White
  * Workaround for when mezzanine is hosted under a different urlspace.(Only tested with Django admin, not grappelli)The keywords.js file needs to reference a mezzanine URL, from the admin site.It used to use a hard-coded string with a root-absolute path, but this failed when mezzanine was hosted elsewhere.Instead, we now reference a global Mezzanine JS object, which is set by template, using URL reversal to find the correct url.This requires a reworking in how the PageAdmin object accesses its Media settings - previously the list of js files was calculated at module load time, but at this stage the url reversal mechanism won't work, because the urls.py aren't all loaded yet, Instead, we hide the list generation inside a lazy iterator object and create the list on demand - Toby White
  * Fix admin menu for earlier than Python 2.6 which lacks ``tuple.index`` - stephenmcd
  * add active class to footer menu - lexual

  * Add a note about required Python and Django versions to the README - stephenmcd

Apply this to both the admin dropdown menu and to the base admin template making all templates aware of the ``admin_keyword_submit`` URL so that it does not need to be hard-coded - stephenmcd
  * Backed out changeset: d43f3e430d1f - stephenmcd
  * Replace MobileTemplate middleware with a decorator.If mezzanine is being used as an application within another project, then the MobileTemplate middleware may not be appropriate to use on URLs outside of mezzanine's control.In fact, if the project uses other calling conventions (eg class-based views) then the middleware may fail completely - Toby White
